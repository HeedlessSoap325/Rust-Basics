# Rust-Basics
I have decided to learn Rust in my free time. 

The course I will be using is [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpPEoZW5IiY) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

This GitHub repo is meant to hold all the files for the course and serve as an example library for later.
